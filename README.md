# Ng-autocomplete-address

Initially, apply Angular Material Autocomplete with Address checking using Google Maps Api.
[/ng-material-autocomplete]

After this step, one attempt to implement a plunker example, without "Angular Material", using just a simple integration between the 'ngAutocomplete' with the 'maps' API from Google.
[/ng-modules-autocomplete]

For a while, I prefer the second approach. Now I gonna try to modify the initial behavior for complete multiple form fields.
[/ng-modules-autocomplete-modified]
